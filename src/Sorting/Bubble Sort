It  is also known as Sinking Sort and Exchange Sort
With Every Step Target Element Comes AT the End

S.C. = O(1)

these algorithm are called in place sorting as no space is required

it is a stable sorting algorithm as the order remains same for equal values

t.c. = O(n) (BEST CASE)
      = O(n2) (WORST CASE DESCENDING ORDER)
